# Project-7
Development of a web app and its deployment in a cloud service that will make it accessible to the public.

In this app we can see the data on car sales advertisements in the United States
We can find two graphs:
1. Histogram: Shows the number of cars sold per odometer
2. Dispersion: Shows the odometer price relationship
